<h1> Project List</h1>
<ul>
  <li><h2> Car Detection </h2>
      <p>
          This Project is about detecting the car on road, from another car's dashboard's perspective. The concept of YOLO archiecture is used in this project. This project is part of coding implementation of yolo explained in Coursera Course Convolution Neural Networks.
